# About

This project is in part inspired by my time at the [CBC](https://cbc.ca) in Vancouver. The handling of streaming MetaData was a crucial aspect to the product created by the team at [CBC Music](https://www.cbc.ca/music).

I've done a few incarnations of personal music data analysis over the years, but this is my first attempt to build something that anyone can use to explore their own MetaData.
